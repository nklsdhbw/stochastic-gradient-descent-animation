## 🚀 Getting started
### 🐍 Python
Download and install [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### ⬇️ Download repository
Run the following command in your terminal to clone the repo.

	git clone https://github.com/nklsdhbw/stochastic-gradient-descent-animation.git
 
### ⚙️ Create virtual environment
Create a new virtual environment called `sgd` by running the following command

	python3.12 -m venv nlp

  
Afterwards activate your freshly created virtual environment

If you're using Windows then run

	source nlp\Scripts\activate

If you're using MacOs or Linux run

	source nlp/bin/activate

Now install all the required packages from `requirements.txt` by running

	pip install -r requirements.txt

Now you are finished and can call the individual scripts by calling the following commands in the console of the virtual environment

	manim -pqh <script>
